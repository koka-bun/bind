# std extensions

These are std extensions required by koka-bun but which haven't yet
been merged into mainline Koka. Since these are drawn from outstanding
PRs against Koka, licenses and copyrights are in the file headers and
are different from the rest of the repo.

The files are trimmed down to only the functions that we need.
